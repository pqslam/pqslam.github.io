        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a software developer with over a decade of experience building impactful solutions, from industrial zone management systems to engaging online shopping platforms. My journey began at TMA Solutions, where I honed my Java and web development skills, leading to co-founding Bluebox Technologies and contributing to Vietnam's tech scene. I'm also passionate about education, having served as a researcher and instructor at International University - VNU HCMC. My journey reflects my commitment to continuous learning and the transformative power of technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            My success is driven by a thirst for knowledge and a knack for self-directed learning. I thrive on embracing new challenges, dissecting complex concepts, and emerging with a comprehensive understanding. This self-sufficiency led to recognition at both TMA Solutions and International University, where my proactive approach and ability to navigate intricate technical landscapes are highly valued. My tenacity and adaptability are cornerstones of my success.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I'm pursuing a second Master's degree in Computational Science at Laurentian University to delve deeper into the theoretical foundations of computer science, particularly within the burgeoning field of Artificial Intelligence. Driven by the transformative power of AI, I'm transitioning towards a career as a Machine Learning Engineer or Prompt Engineer. I'm confident my experience and passion for learning will allow me to contribute meaningfully to this exciting field and I'm eager to embrace the challenges and adventures that await.
